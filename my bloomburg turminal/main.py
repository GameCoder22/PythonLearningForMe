# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
